==== Overview
This extension enables addition of Holographic Remoting capability to OpenXR applications and games.

Holographic Remoting is a technology that uses a network connection to stream rendered holographic content 
from a PC to an HMD or a mobile device running a suitable Holographic Remoting player app, 
and to relay pose data and spatial input from the player device back to the remote application.
Holographic Remoting streams high-resolution/highly-detailed content to devices like Microsoft HoloLens 2 
or a Windows Mixed Reality PC in real-time thereby allowing rendering of immersive views on perfomance constrained devices.

Setting up a remoting connection requires some extra steps in the OpenXR initialization workflow:
* Setting remoting configuration parameters, such as maximum bitrate and video codec to use
* Initiating an outgoing network connection or listening for incoming connections
* Waiting until a connection has been established (optional)
If the application does not wait for a successful connection before creating a session, session creation will block 
until either a connection has been established or the connection attempt has failed.

Note that some player device properties, such as elink:XrViewConfigurationType and elink:XrEnvironmentBlendMode,
can only return actual values after a remoting connection has been established. Before this point, default values 
are returned for these properties. The recommended approach is therefore to create the slink:XrSession 
before enumerating the device properties.

This extension uses a slightly modified two-call idiom when calling the callback. A buffer of an initial size
is already passed in the first call, but the callback implementation can request a larger buffer (of up to 1 KiB)
following the Buffer Size Parameter Behavior. The callback function will then be called again with a buffer of the
requested size.

For more details regarding the handling of buffer size parameters in OpenXR, 
please refer to : https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenXR/specs/1.0/html/xrspec.html#buffer-size-parameters 

The value written to tokenBuffer is expected to be a null-terminated string.
